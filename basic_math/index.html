  <h1>JS Atomic 05</h1>
  
  <h2>What happens when you try to parse the integer out of a string like "Error 404"? How about "404 Error"? Other combinations of numbers and letters? What needs to be true about the incoming string for it to be parsed correctly?</h2>
  <p>If the start of the string contains numbers ('404 Error') then it will store 404. The incoming string must contain only 1 'group', either a string, or integer.</p>

  <h2>What happens if one (or more) of the inputs are non-numeric text (like a comma or a dollar-sign)? What errors occur, if any? What does the console output tell you?</h2>
  <p>No error seems to occur, I see nothing in the console output. The incorrect text is saved as NaN</p>
  
  <h2>Why might you use the increment (++) or decrement (--) operators? What are some applications that you predict might come into play?</h2>
  <p>I would imagine they are commonly used for looping.</p>
