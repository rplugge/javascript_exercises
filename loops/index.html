  <h1>07-E - Re-do the previous 4 exercises, but with a for loop instead of a while loop.</h1>

  <h2>Apart from changing your loop headers, what other changes do you need to make for each?</h2>
  <p>I found I was able to take out the incrementation of my variable and put it in the arguements, also I can declare variables in the arguements as well.</p>
  
  <h2>Given that you use either loop structure interchangeably, what do the different loop structures seem suited for?</h2>
  <p>For loop seem to be a better option whenever running a loop with minimal logic involved. If/else loops still seem to be better suited for use with more complex logic.</p>
