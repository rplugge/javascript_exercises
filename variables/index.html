  <h1>JS Atomic 03</h1>
  
  <h2>Given what you know so far, what are some reasons to use variables?</h2>
  <p>I would use variables for the same reason I do with Ruby. To store information inside of an object. Either to avoid repeating it, or to allow the use of different information(variables).</p>
  
  <h2>What are some advantages to variable names like hairColor instead of hc (for example)? What are some disadvantages?</h2>
  <p>The most obvious advantage would be clarity. I really can't think of disadvantages, except if you were trying to keep your file as small as possible.</p>
  
  <h2>Given what you know so far, what can you predict about other ways we might use variables?</h2>
  <p>We can use variables to run logic, to output different information(variables) based on that logic, or just to store information that will be repeated.</p>
  
  <h2>Why don't you need to use the var keyword every time you use a variable (right now, we only use it when we create the variable)? What does var do?</h2>
  <p>Using the 'var' keyword simply declares a variable of that name. We call the variable often, but usually only set its value once.</p>
  
  <h2>What happens if you try to do output with a variable without first assigning a value to that variable? What happens? Does the program still work as intended? Do error messages show up in the console? If so, what error message?</h2>
  <p>It seems to give an error message in the console stating that that variable is not yet defined. The program does still work at intended (does not display the 'error' section)</p>
