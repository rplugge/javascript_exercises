  <h1>JS Atomic 04</h1>
  
  <h2>What is the data-type (e.g. string or integer) of the information that comes in? What happens if the user inputs a number -- does it stay an integer? Use typeof and console.log() to help with this.</h2>
  <p>The information that is stored is stored as a string by default. Numbers are converted to strings.</p>
  
  <h2>What happens if the user clicks "OK" (or equivalent) without typing anything in? What information gets assigned to a variable, if any?</h2>
  <p>If a user clicks OK without typing anything in then it saves an empty string as the variable information.</p>
  
  <h2>How did you choose your variable names? If you gave a list of variable names to someone who hasn't seen your code, could they reasonably predict what information you might store in each?</h2>
  <p>I try and make variables names as specific as they can be (within reason). For hair color of a user I store userHairColor. I believe someone could get a basic understanding of what's going on through my variable names.</p>
  
  <h2>If you completely changed a question you were asking the user, would it make sense to totally rename the variable? What if you changed the order of your questions?</h2>
  <p>Yes, if I changed what the question was asking I would change the name of the variable. Not if the order changed.</p>
  
  <h2>In these exercises, we use prompt() to collect information, but most websites do that ask for information do not use prompt() -- how do they collect information (what HTML elements do they use)? What might be an advantage to doing it that way instead of with prompt()? Are there any disadvantages? Why might you use prompt()?</h2>
  <p>I imagine most websites use entry forms to collect information which is then stored to variable. I believe that is better 75% of the time. But sometimes you need information before you display parts (all) of a webpage, then you would need a prompt.</p>
  
  <h2>Research prompt() -- is there any way to make it so that there are two (or more) fields?</h2>
  <p>From what i've read, you cannot make multiple fields in just one prompt.</p>
