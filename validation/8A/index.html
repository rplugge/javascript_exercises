  <h1>08-A</h1>

  <h2>What does this program look like if done with a while loop? With a for loop? Which is better?</h2>
  <p>The only major difference I see is moving the variable into the arguements. I'm not sure which is better, even though I thought I like while loops the 'for' loops is growing on me.</p>
  
  <h2>Did you use == or ===? Does it matter?</h2>
  <p>I used ==. I don't believe it matter's in this scenario.</p>
