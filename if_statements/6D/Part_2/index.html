  <h1>06-D Pt. 2</h1>

  <h2>Does it matter what order your if / else if statements happen? If you reorder them, does your program still produce correct output?</h2>
  <p>Yes, when using if/else-if/else it will display the first 'true' it comes across. If I changed the order then it may not display the one I meant it to.</p>
  
  <h2>What's wrong with this conditional: if (age < 16 && age > 21)?</h2>
  <p>'age' can not be less than 16 and greater than 21.</p>
  
  <h2>Let's say that your program needs to be easy to modify so that it works in parts of the country/world where the age ranges are different. How would you replace the numbers in your if statements with variables to make the program make sense? Or is it easier to just have the numbers be there? Does it matter?</h2>
  <p>I would set a variable equal to the different ages that the country uses. The 'drinking' portion could be made into us_drinkingAge and german_drinkingAge. Where us_drinkingAge would be 21 and german_drinkingAge could be 18 or whatever.</p>
