  <h1>06-D Pt. 1</h1>

  <h2>Does it matter what order your if-statements are in?</h2>
  <p>The order only matters if you wish the returns to be displayed in a certain order</p>
  
  <h2>When testing ranges, did you use &&, ||, or something else entirely (e.g. nested if-statements)? If you used &&, why is that a better choice than || (and vice-versa)?</h2>
  <p>I used && (and). I wanted both sections to return true for the alert to be displayed.</p>
  
  <h2>What types of input produce a value of NaN after parsing? Is it important to check for NaN values? Is it possible for a NaN value to trigger any of the other if-statements? If so, how and why?</h2>
  <p>Anything that is not an integer will return NaN if tried to be made into an integer. It is important if you only want to work with integers. I believe the string '25' will trigger some of my if statements because '25' == 25</p>
