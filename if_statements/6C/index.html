  <h1>06-C</h1>
  
  <h2>If you collect the user's input as a string (i.e. without using parseInt() to turn it into an integer), does == work to compare the input to the stored secret number? Would === work? Which is best?</h2>
  <p>'==' still works because it compares strings/integers. '===' checks if class is equal as well, which would mean you have to store user input as an integer (or store the answer as a string). I believe == is a bit easier to manage.</p>
  
  <h2>If you collect the user's input as an integer (i.e. by using parseInt() to turn it into an integer), can you use == to compare? ===? Which is better in this case?</h2>
  <p>You can still use '==' and '==='. It would be better to use '===' if you're parsing the variable into an integer.</p>
  
  <h2>What is the difference between == and ===?</h2>
  <p>'==' checks if the values are equal (regardless or integer or string), '===' checks if they are equal and that their class is equal (both strings or integers).</p>
  
  <h2>In this case, does it make more sense to leave the user's guess as a string, or to convert it to an integer? Why? What are the relative advantages / disadvantages of each approach (particularly in terms of the types of new features that might be able to be added)?</h2>
  <p>I feel like it is fine to leave it as a string in this case because we aren't using it in any logic where it needs to be an INT. If you did want to use it (to add/subtract etc) you would need to change it into an INT.</p>
