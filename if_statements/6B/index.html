  <h1>06-B</h1>
  
  <h2>Does it matter if the user-provided password matches your password exactly, or is there some flexibility allowed in capitalization?</h2>
  <p>I believe it must match exactly, I see no flexibility in capitlazition.</p>
  
  <h2>Did you use = or == or === to compare passwords (or something else)? Why? Would any of the others work?</h2>
  <p>I used '=='. The password is stored as a string and all input from prompt is returned as a string so '===' would be redundant in this situation. I believe others would work, and may even be necessary depending on circumstance.</p>
  
  <h2>Why is it a bad idea to store a password (or other sensitive information) in plain text in a Javascript file?</h2>
  <p>It isn't recommended to store a password in a Javascript file because anyone looking at the source could would find the password.</p>
