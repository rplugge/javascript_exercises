  <h2>(true == 'true')</h2>
  <p>The answer was false. '==' checks if the sides match values (whether string or int). I guessed true, and it was false. I assumed the return of true was a string. It is not.</p>
  
  <h2>(true === 'true')</h2>
  <p>The answer was false. '===' checks if the sides match values and type (i.e. String or Int). I guessed false, and it was false.</p>
  
  <h2>(true == false)</h2>
  <p>The answer was false. '==' checks if the sides match (whether string or int). I guessed false, and it was false.</p>

  <h2>(5 != 12)</h2>
  <p>The answer was true. '!==' checks if the sides do not match (whether string or int). I guessed true, and it was true.</p>
  
  <h2>(5 < 12)</h2>
  <p>The answer was true. '<' checks if the left side is less than the right side. I guessed true, and it was true.</p>
  
  <h2>(5 <= 12)</h2>
  <p>The answer was true. '<=' checks if the left side is less than or equal to the right side. I guessed true, and it was true.</p>
  
  <h2>(5 > 12)</h2>
  <p>The answer was false. '>' checks if the right side is less than the left side. I guessed false, and it was false.</p>
  
  <h2>(5 >= 12)</h2>
  <p>The answer was false. '>=' checks if the right side is less than or equal to the left side. I guessed false, and it was false.</p>
  
  <h2>What do you call true and false values?</h2>
  <p>Boolean Values</p>
  
  <h2>How is true similar or dissimilar from "true"? Can they be used in the same way?</h2>
  <p>They are not the same. The string 'true' holds no value, it is not a boolean value.</p>
